# Olivia's Simply Typed Lambda Calculus
Hi! This is the repository which contains my experiments with writing the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus and its many facets.

# Roadmap / Ideamap
1. Write core constructions of STLC using OCaml.
2. Write a substitution based interpreter.
3. Generate a parser with Menhir.
4. Write a tree-walking type checker with annotated lambdas.
